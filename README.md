**I came into data field for**
- 🥇 I'm passionate about industries that can be driven by data leverage. Take action and get results, satisfying me a lot.
- 🥈 I often dive into **user psychology** like a PM, which is a fascinating process of exploring root causes.
- 🥉 I will definitely obtain a graduate degree in data science in the future, but not my immediate priority at the moment.
- 🚗 In the past 1.5 years, I embarked on a cross-country road trip to ponder over how to live my life instead of mindlessly working(❎a dead-alive person❎), back here with a tranquil and steady core.
